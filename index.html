  <td><tr>A vacationing penguin is driving his car through Arizona when he notices that the oil pressure light is on. He gets out to look and sees oil dripping out of the motor. He drives to the nearest town and stops at the first gas station. After dropping the car off, the penguin goes for a walk around town. He sees an ice-cream shop and, being a penguin in Arizona, decides that something cold would really hit the spot. He gets a big dish of ice cream and sits down to eat. Having no hands he makes a real mess trying to eat with his flippers. After finishing his ice cream, he goes back to the gas station and asks the mechanic if he's found the problem. The mechanic looks up and says "It looks like you blew a seal." "No no," the penguin replies, "it's just ice cream."</tr></td>
  <td><tr>A young man was at a farm, visiting from the city. He was looking around and he asked the farmer, "I was wondering, is there a reason that cow doesn't have horns?" The farmer said, "Well, some cows just never have horns. Other cows, when they get older, we remove  their horns so they don't get too dangerous. And some cows when they're calves we treat them so they don't get horns as they get older. But sir, the reason that cow doesn't have horns is because it's a horse."</tr></td>
  <td><tr>Two ranchers were leaning on a fence next to each other as the sun set.

The other rancher was silent for a while, then he spit on the ground and said, "Yeah, I used to have a truck like that..."</tr></td>

Both of the cowboy ran to the tree and gazed adoringly and in hunger at the branches. All of a sudden they were surrounded by Indians and shot dead.

  <td><tr>A physicist, a mathematician, and an engineer are all found guilty of treason and sentenced to death by guillotine. The priest reads them their last rites, then the king orders the executioner to kill the physicist. The executioner offers the physicist two choices: would he like a hood on or off, and would he like to be executed face up or face down. The physicist replies, "I spent my whole life studying the heavens. I would like to face the sky, with the hood on like night!" The executioner positions the physicist and drops the blade and it stops inches from the physicists' neck. The priest cries, "It's a sign from God! This man is innocent! Set him free!", so the king pardons him, and orders the mathematician executed next. The executioner offers the mathematician the same choices: would he like a hood on or off, and would he like to be executed face up or face down. The mathematician replies, "They all result in an equivalent state, but hood off face down is the most elegant solution!" The executioner positions the mathematician and drops the blade and it stops inches from the mathematician's neck. The priest cries, "It's a sign from God! This man is innocent! Set him free!", so the king pardons him, and orders the engineer executed next. The executioner offers the engineer the same choices: would he like a hood on or off, and would he like to be executed face up or face down. The engineer replies, "I have always loved machines, and there is no more elegant a killing machine than the guillotine. I will spend my final moments marveling in its beauty!"

  <td><tr>A city slicker was duck hunting in the country. The hunter stirs up a flock of ducks and shoots one in flight. The duck falls onto the roof of a farm house and then to the ground. The hunter crawls over the fence and is sneaking over to the dead duck when the farmer jumps out from around the corner and says, "What are you doing on my propery!?" The hunter replies, "Sorry to bother you. I came out here from the city on a hunting vacation. The duck I shot fell in your yard and I'd like to retrieve it." "Like hell you are! That's my duck!" replied the farmer. "Well, no," replied the hunter. "You see, I shot the duck so it's my duck." The farmer replies, "You city folk don't respect personal property. Looks like there is only one way to settle this." "What's that?" asked the hunter. "Country style," replies the farmer. "What's country style?" "Country style is where we take turns kicking each other in the nuts. The last one standing gets the duck." The hunter thinks about this uneasy proposition for a moment, but agrees. "Good, I'll go first," says the farmer. The farmer swings his leg back and with a heavy blow kicks the hunter square in the nuts. The hunter goes down hard, grabbing his crotch, rolling around on the ground and crying like a baby. After 30 minutes the hunter stumbles to his feet and says, "Ok... I guess it's my turn." The farmer looks at the duck and then at the hunter and says, "Nah... you can have the duck."</tr></td>

  <td><tr>A third rate magician is doing magic shows on a second rate cruise ship. The pay is good, the accommodation is comfortable, the food is excellent, and the two show a day workload is easy. The mainly elderly audience seem to enjoy his show which is unoriginal but has the polish of hundreds of repetitions. All in all, it's started out as a great gig except for one glaring issue. The captain has a talking parrot that he brings to every show. It has worked out how all the tricks are done and gives away his secrets to the audience after every trick. "It's a fake water jug Squarrrrk!" "The rabbit is under his hat Squarrrk!" "The girl is hiding under a trap door Squarrrk!" Now the audience finds this hilarious. So instead of coming to see a magic show the crowds are coming to see him being humiliated by a parrot, 2 shows a day, 7 days a week. Utterly depressed and desperate, the magician struggles to find a spectacular new trick to wow the crowd and that the parrot can't work out. He eventually announces an elaborate disappearing trick involving pyrotechnics and a ring of fire, however the first night he tries it, he accidentally ignites a nearby gas line causing a catastrophic chain of explosions that causes the ship to break apart and sink almost immediately. The next morning the sun rises on an empty ocean except for a single piece of shattered lifeboat with the magician clinging to one end and the parrot perched at the other end out of reach. The magician glares at the parrot and the parrot stares back, but not a word is said. This goes on for a day, then another day. On the third day the parrot finally breaks the silence. "OK, I give up. Where's the ship?"</tr></td>
  
  <td><tr>A horny gorilla sees a lion bent over a small stream, taking a drink. The gorilla runs up behind the lion, grabs on, and has his way with him. The gorilla then takes off running, with the very angry lion on his heels. As they run through the jungle, the gorilla gets a bit of a lead, and sees a British safari camp ahead. The gorilla enters the camp, grabs some khakis that are hung out to dry, and puts on pants, a shirt, and a hat. He sits on a chair by the campfire and grabs a copy of the local paper, pretending to read, to hide his face. The lion enters the campsite and lets out a huge roar. He yells, "Did anyone see a gorilla run through here?" The gorilla, in full disguise, calls out, "You mean the one that fucked the lion up the ass?" The lion exclaims, "Oh my god! It's in the paper already?"</tr></td>
  <td><tr>A man wakes up one morning to find a gorilla in a tree in near his home. He searches online and finds a local gorilla removal service and calls immediately. "Is it a boy or a girl gorilla?" the service guy asks. "Boy," replies the homeowner. The service guy says, "Alright no problem, I can do it. I'll be right there." An hour later the service guy shows up with a stick, a Chihuahua, a shotgun, and a pair of handcuffs. He tells the homeowner, "Now, I'm going to climb this tree and poke the gorilla with the stick until he falls. When he does, the trained Chihuahua will bite the gorilla's testicles off. The gorilla will then cross his hands to protect himself and allow you to put the handcuffs on him." The man asks, "What do I do with the shotgun?" The service guy replies, "If I fall out of the tree before the gorilla, shoot the Chihuahua."</tr></td>

  <td><tr>Mike and his wife Sara went to the state fair every year, and every year Mike would say, "Sara, I'd like to ride in that airplane." Sara always replied, "I know, Mike, but that airplane ride costs fifty dollars, and fifty dollars is fifty dollars." One year Mike and Sara went to the fair, and Mike said, "Sara, I'm eighty-five years old. If I don't ride that airplane, I might never get another chance." Sara replied, "Mike, that airplane ride costs fifty dollars, and fifty dollars is fifty dollars." The pilot overheard them and said, "Folks, I'll make you a deal. I'll take you both up for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not say one word, I won't charge you; but if you say one word, it's fifty dollars." Mike and Sara agreed, and up they went. The pilot did all kinds of twists and turns, rolls and dives, but not a word was spoken. He did all his tricks over again but still not a word. When they landed, the pilot turned to Mike and said, "My, my, I did everything I could think of to get you to yell out, but you didn't." Mike replied, "Well, I was gonna say something when Sara fell out, but fifty dollars is fifty dollars."</tr></td>

To save time we just give them numbers and tell those instead." The new guy says, "Oh I think I understand. Let me try. 63!" There's dead silence. The new guy asks, "What's wrong, is that one not funny?" His cellmate replies, "Nah, it's a good one. Some people just don't know how tell a joke."</tr></td>

"Hey can you break a 15 dollar bill for me?" one of the counterfeiters asks. "Oh, sure, no problem," the cashier says. The counterfeiters grin at each other.

  <td><tr>God created the dog and said, "Sit all day by the door of your house and bark at anyone who comes in or walks past. For this, I will give you a life span of twenty years." The dog said, "That's a long time to be barking. How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten?" So God agreed. God created the monkey and said, "Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh. For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span." The monkey said, "Tricks for twenty years? That's a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the Dog did?" And God agreed. God created the cow and said, "You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years." The cow said, "That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?" And God agreed again. God created man and said, "Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. For this, I'll give you twenty years." But man said, "Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?" "Okay," said God, "You asked for it." So that is why for our first twenty years we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves. For the next forty years we slave in the sun to support our family. For the next ten years we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren. And for the last ten years we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone. Life has now been explained to you.</tr></td>

  <tr><td>Tom had been in the liquor business for 25 years. Finally, sick of the stress, he quits his job and buys 50 acres of land in Alaska, as far from humanity as possible. He sees the postman once a week and gets groceries once a month. Otherwise it’s total peace and quiet. After six months or so of almost total isolation, someone knocks on his door. He opens it, and a huge, bearded man is standing there. “Name’s Lars, your neighbor from forty miles up the road. Having a Christmas party Friday night, thought you might like to come. About 5:00.” “Great”, says Tom, “after six months out here I’m ready to meet some local folks. Thank you.” As Lars is leaving, he stops. “Gotta warn you ... be some drinkin.” “Not a problem” says Tom. “After 25 years in the business, I can drink with the best of ‘em.” Again, the big man starts to leave and stops. “More ‘n’ likely gonna be some fightin’ too.” “Well, I get along with people, I’ll be all right. I’ll be there, thanks again.” “More’n likely be some wild sex, too.” “Now that’s really not a problem,” says Tom, warming to the idea. “I’ve been all alone for six months! I’ll definitely be there. By the way, what should I wear?” “Don’t much matter ... just gonna be the two of us.”</td></tr>

The crew started getting to know her and waved at her and then one day they got her a little helmet and a small hammer and they would give her little jobs to do. After a few weeks of this, they gave her a "paycheck" of $10. She was so proud, and her Mom said "why don't we open a bank account for you and you can deposit your check?" At the bank the little girl explained that she got this for her work as a construction worker at the new house. The teller asked her "oh, wow, that's great!  How has it been going?" The little girl said "well, it would be fine if the f*ing lazy-ass sons-of-bitches would deliver the f*ing drywall"</td></tr>
  
  <tr><td>A cowboy rode into town and stopped at a saloon for a drink. Unfortunately, the locals always had a habit of picking on strangers, which he was. When he finished his drink, he found his horse had been stolen. He went back into the bar, handily flipped his gun into the air, caught it above his head without even looking and fired a shot into the ceiling. "Which one of you sidewinders stole my horse?!" he yelled with surprising forcefulness. No one answered. "Alright, I'm gonna have another beer, and if my horse ain't back outside by the time I finish, I'm gonna do what I dun in Texas! And I don't like to have to do what I dun in Texas!" Some of the locals shifted restlessly. The man, true to his word, had another beer, walked outside, and his horse has been returned to the post. He saddled up and started to ride out of town. The bartender wandered out of the bar and asked, "Say partner, before you go... what happened in Texas?" The cowboy turned back and said, "I had to walk home."</td></tr>

  <tr><td>A guy has spent five years traveling all around the world making a documentary on native dances. At the end of this time, he has every single dance of every single indigenous culture in the world. He winds up in Australia, in Alice Springs, so he pops into a pub for a well-earned beer. He gets talking to one of the local Aborigines and tells him about his project. The Aborigine asks the guy what he thought of the Butcher Dance. The guy's a bit confused and says, “Butcher Dance? What's that?” “What? You haven't seen the Butcher Dance?” “No, I've never heard of it.” “Oh mate. You are crazy. How can you say you filmed every native dance if you haven't seen the Butcher Dance?” “Umm. I got a corroboree on film just the other week. Is that what you mean?” "No no, not corroboree. Butcher Dance is much more important than corroboree.” “Oh. Well how can I see this Butcher Dance then?” “Mate, Butcher Dance is right out in th’ bush. It takes many days of travel to go see Butcher Dance.” “Look, I've been everywhere from the forests of the Amazon, to deepest darkest Africa, to the frozen wastes of the Arctic, filming these dances. Nothing will prevent me from recording this one last dance!” “OK, mate. You drive north along Stuart Highway towards Darwin. After you drive 250km, you'll see a dirt track off to the left. Follow the dirt track for 150km until you see a huge, dead gum tree - biggest tree you ever seen. Here you gotta leave the car, because it's much too rough for driving. You strike out due West into the setting sun. You walk three days til you hit a creek. You follow this creek to northwest. After two days you reach a place where the creek flows out of rocky mountains. It's much too difficult to cross the mountains here though. You now head south for a half day til you see a pass through the mountains. The pass is very difficult and very dangerous. Takes two, maybe three days to get through the rocky pass. When you're through, head northwest for four days until you reach a big huge rock - 15m high and shaped like a man's head. From whi rock, walk due west for two days and you reach a village. Here you'll see the Butcher Dance.” So, the guy grabs his camera crew and equipment and heads out. After a couple of hours he finds the dirt track. The track is in a shocking state and he's forced to crawl along at a snail's pace and so he doesn't reach the tree until dusk, and he's forced to set up camp for the night. He sets out bright and early the following morning. His spirits are high and he's excited about the prospect of capturing on film this mysterious dance which he has never heard mentioned before. True to the directions he has been given, he reaches the creek after three days and follows it for another two until he reaches the rocky mountains. The merciless sun is starting to take its toll by this time and his spirits are starting to flag, but wearily he trudges on until he finds the pass through the hills, confident that nothing will prevent him from completing his life's dream. The mountains prove to be every bit as treacherous as his guide said, and at times he almost despairs of getting his bulky equipment through. But after three and a half days of back breaking effort he finally forces his way clear and continues his long trek. When he reaches the huge rock, four days later, his water is running low and his feet are covered with blisters. Yet he steels himself and heads out on the last leg of his journey. Two days later he virtually staggers into the village where the Aborigines feed him and give him fresh water. He begins to feel like a new man. Once he's recovered enough, the guy goes before the village Elder and tells him that he has come to film their Butcher Dance. “Oh mate. It's very bad you come today. Butcher Dance last night. You're too late. You missed the dance!” “Well, when do you hold the next dance?” “Not 'til next year!” “Well, I've come all this way. Couldn't you just hold an extra dance for me, tonight?” "No, no, no. Butcher Dance is very sacred. Only held once a year. If we hold more, the spirits get very angry. You want to see Butcher Dance? You come back next year.” The guy is devastated, but he has no other option but to head back to civilization and back home. The following year, he heads back to Australia and, determined not to miss out again, sets out a week earlier than last time. He is quite willing to spend a week with the Aboriginal people before the dance is performed in order to ensure he is present to witness it. However, right from the start things go wrong. Heavy rains that year have turned the dirt track to mud and the car gets bogged every few kilometres, finally forcing him to abandon his vehicle and slog through the mud on foot almost half the distance to the tree. He reaches the creek and the mountains without any further hitch, but halfway through the ascent of the mountain he is struck by a fierce storm which rages for several days, during which he is forced to cling forlornly to the mountainside until it subsides. It would be suicide to attempt to scale the treacherous paths in the face of such savage elements. Then, before he has travelled a kilometre out from the mountains, he sprains his ankle badly which slows down the rest of his journey to the rock enormously. Eventually, having lost all sense of how long he has been travelling, he staggers into the community at about 12 noon. “The Butcher Dance!” gasps the guy. “Please don't tell me I'm too late!” The Elder recognises him and says, “No, whitefella, Butcher Dance performed tonight. You arrived just in time!” Relieved beyond measure, he spends the rest of the afternoon setting up his equipment - preparing to capture the night's ritual on celluloid. As dusk falls, the Aborigines start to cover their bodies in white paint and adorn themselves in bird feathers and animal skins. Once darkness has settled fully over the land, the dancers form a circle around a huge roaring fire. A deathly hush descends over the performers and spectators alike, as a wizened old figure with elaborate swirling designs covering his entire body enters the circle and begins to chant. “Some sort of witch doctor or medicine man,” thinks the guy, and he whispers to the Elder, “What's he doing?” “Hush,”whispers the Elder. “You're the first whitefella to ever see the most sacred of our rituals. You must remain silent. This holy man, he asks that the spirits of the Dreaming watch as we demonstrate our devotion to them through our dance and, if they like our dancing, will they be so gracious as to watch over us and protect us for another year.” The chanting of the holy man reaches a stunning crescendo before he moves himself from the circle. From somewhere the rhythmic pounding of clapsticks reverberate out across the land and the dancers begin to sway to the stirring rhythm. The guy is becoming caught up in the fervour of the moment himself. This is it. He now realises beyond all doubt that his wait has not been in vain. He is about to witness the ultimate performance of rhythm and movement ever conceived by humanity. The Elder strides to his position in the circle and, in a big booming voice, starts to sing. “You butch yer right arm in. You butch yer right arm out. You butch yer right arm in and you shake it all about…”</td></tr>
  <tr><td>A farmer buys a new stud rooster and introduces him to the hen house. Immediately the stud rooster mates with all 150 hens and then repeats the ritual with all 150 hens the same afternoon. The next day the stud rooster repeats the ritual and also mates with all of the ducks and geese on the farm. The third day the stud rooster mates with all the hens, ducks and geese. Then the farmer finds the stud rooster laying on the ground half dead with vultures circling overhead. The farmer yells at the stud rooster, "Serves you right you horney bastard!". The stud rooster raises his head slightly with his one eye on the sky and whispers, "Shhhhh. They're about to land."</td></tr>
  <tr><td>A farmer is driving down a back country road on his way to a meeting at the community center that he is late for. He sees an injured bird on the side of the road and pulls over to see if there is anything he can do to help the bird. Turns out that the bird has an injured wing and can be saved. The farmer doesn't have time to take the bird to the vet so he sets the wing, gets a fresh cow pie from the farm field and makes a cast around the bird to keep the wing stable. The farmer places the bird back on the side of the road with the intention of coming back for it after the meeting. After the farmer leaves the bird is feeling pretty good. The injured wing feels ok and the cow pie is nice and warm. So the bird starts to sing a happy tune. From across the field a fox hears the bird singing and comes to investigate. Low and behold, the fox finds dinner waiting for him on the side of the road.

  <tr><td>I use to take an annual family trip to Iowa to visit relatives. This was farm country and all we had to do to entertain ourselves was go visit the neighboring farms. One time I visited farmer Jeb and his pig farm. While I was there I noticed there was a pig with a wooden leg. I aske farmer Jeb, "Farmer Jeb, why does that pig have a wooden leg?", Farmer Jeb replied, "Well... you might have noticed our farm house burned down." "Yes," I said. "But why does the pig have a wooden leg?" "Well," said farmer Jeb. "The farm house caught fire in the middle of the night. The missus and I were asleep in bed. That there pig climbed out of the pen, came over to the window and with his snout started knocking. He did that until we woke up. We got out of the house just in time before the whole place collapsed. That there pig done saved our lives." "That's an amazing story, farmer Jeb. But it doesn't answer my question! Why does the pig have a wooden leg?" I repeated. "Well... you know my son Billy?" "Yes," I replied. "Well... the missus and I were out plowing the field and Billy fell down our well. We had no idea he was down there and he was about to drown. That there pig went and got a length of rope and threw the end down the well. That there pig then hauled Billy up. If it weren't for that there pig I wouldn't have a son." "That is amazing!" I replied. "But why does the pig have a wooden leg!?" Farmer Jeb replied, "Well... a pig that special, you don't eat all at once."</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Back in college I bartended to make money. The first thing they teach you in bartending school is how to make a drink. The second thing they tell you is NEVER serve a drunk. My first night bartending a drunk walks in and sets himself down at the bar. I walk over to him and explain, "Sir, I will not serve you. You are a drunk." "I don't want a drink!" he retorts. "Well, what is it you want then?" I ask. "I want to play darts!" he says. "Sir, I can't let you play darts. You will hurt yourself or someone else." "I WANT TO PLAY DARTS!" he replies. I look around and there aren't many folks in the bar so I tell him, "I'll let you throw one dart." I hand him the dart, he leans back on the stool and hurls the dart at the dartboard. By gosh, he throws a bullseye! "What do I win?" he asks. "Sir, this isn't a carnaval. I don't..." "WHAT DO I WIN!?" he interrupts. I look behind the bar for something to give him and I see a shoebox with a turtle in it down in the bottom corner of the bar. So, I give him the shoebox. He takes it an leaves. Two weeks later the same guy stumbles into the bar and sits down at the counter. I tell him, "Sir, I will not serve you. You are a drunk." "I don't want a drink!" he retorts. "Well, what do you want?" "I want to play darts!" he replies. I know that if I don't give him a dart he's going to get upset. There aren't many folks in the bar so I give him one dart. He leans back on the stool, hurls the dart at the dartboard and hits the bullseye again! "What do I win?" he asks? I look behind the bar for something to give him, but I don't see anything. Scratching my head I ask him, "Sir, what did I give you last time?" He replies, "Roast beef on a hard role".</td></tr>
  <tr><td>There was a young girl bee that was very precocious. She studied hard, got good grades and graduated from Hive High School as Valedictorian. She gets a full ride scholarship to Hive University because of her efforts. While there she majors in policical science. She gets top marks and completes her undergraduate studies at the top of her class. She goes on and completes her doctorate in political science. Afterwards, she returns to her bee community and decides to use her education for the benefit of her community. She is well versed in public speaking and sets out to campaign for her local office. She wins easily and makes important and beneficial changes for her local bee community. She then sets her sights on state bee office. She campaigns on the improvements she made in her local community and easily wins the state office senate role. She writes important legislation for her state and is involved with passing many important laws. Her reputation is growing and bees really love her. So, she runs for federal bee office and wins by a landslide becoming a federal bee senator. While there she makes a name for herself across the bee country. She again is involved with writing and passing important legislation improving the lives for bees across the country. So, she sets her eyes on becoming president of the bee nation. Given her broad support and popularity she wins the presidency by a landslide. After eight years, she easily won re-election, she has done great work for all bees at home and around the world. This journey has taken many years and she is eager to return home to her bee community. When she arives home, the community celebrates her accomplishments with a huge party. While at the party everyone wants to talk with her. It's hard for her to break away and she is getting thirsty. Once she finally breaks away she heads to the wine bar but the line is too long. So, she heads to the beer bar, but that line is also too long. So, she goes to get some punch, which is good, because, there is no punch line.</td></tr>

"Something for this I have." Yoda says. He reaches into his bag and takes out a bunch of regular dinner table forks and a roll of duct tape. He tapes several forks together to make a bridge and lays it down, allowing the two of them to get across. When they get back to Yoda's hovel, they find that some creature has chewed a hole in the fence around Yoda's garden. "Something I have for this." Yoda says again. Once again, he takes a bunch of forks out of his bag and, using duct tape, tapes them in to patch the hole. Yoda and Luke return to Yoda's home, where Yoda looks through his bag. He's used all his forks but one, he discovers. "That's ok Master." Luke says, wanting to be helpful. "I'll write us a note reminding us to buy more." So he writes the note and uses the very last fork to pin it to the bulletin board. He looks down at Yoda expecting pride, but instead finds a look of horror. "Master Yoda!" he asks. "What did I do wrong?" Yoda replies sagely, "A Jedi uses the forks for no ledge and the fence. Never for a tack!"</td></tr>

  <tr><td>A doctor goes out and buys the best car on the market, a brand new Ferrari GTO. It is also the most expensive car in the world, and it costs him $500,000. He takes it out for a spin and stops at a red light. An old man on a moped, looking about 100 years old, pulls up next to him. The old man looks over at the sleek shiny car and asks, "What kind of car ya got there, sonny?" The doctor replies, "A Ferrari GTO. It cost half a million dollars!" "That's a lot of money," says the old man. "Why does it cost so much?" "Because this car can do up to 250 miles an hour!" states the doctor proudly. The moped driver asks, "Mind if I take a look inside?" "No problem," replies the doctor. So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around. Then, sitting back on his moped, the old man says, "That's a pretty nice car, all right, but I'll stick with my moped!" Just then the light changes, so the doctor decides to show the old man just what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 150 mph. Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear view mirror. He wonders what it could be and suddenly WHHHOOOOOOSSSSSHHH! Something whips by him going much faster! "What on earth could be going faster than my Ferrari?" the doctor asks himself. He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 175 mph. Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it's the old man on the moped! Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 210 mph. WHOOOOOOOSHHHHH! He's feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him AGAIN! Astounded by the speed of his old guy, he floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 250 mph. Not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again! The Ferrari is flat out, and there's nothing he can do! Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end. The doctor stops and jumps out and , unbelievably, the old man is still alive. He runs up to the mangled old man and says, "Oh my gosh! Is there anything I can do for you?" The old man whispers, "Unhook my suspenders from your side mirror."</td></tr>

  <tr><td>A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, "I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away." The distressed woman wailed, "Are you sure?" "Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead," replied the vet. "How can you be so sure?" she protested. "I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something." The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. The vet looked at the woman and said, "I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100 percent certifiably, a dead duck." The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman. The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. "$1,500!" she cried,"$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!" The vet shrugged, "I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500."</td></tr>

  <tr><td>An infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar. The first mathematician orders a beer. The second orders half a beer. "I don't serve half-beers," the bartender replies. "Excuse me?" retorts the second mathematician. "What kind of bar serves half-beers?" The bartender remarks. "That's ridiculous." "Oh c'mon," says the first mathematician. "Do you know how hard it is to collect an infinite number of us? Just play along." "There are very strict laws on how I can serve drinks," replied the bartender. "I couldn't serve you half a beer even if I wanted to." "But that's not a problem," says the third mathematician. "At the end of the joke you serve us a whole number of beers. You see, when you take the sum of a continuously halving function-" "I know how limits work!" interjects the bartender. "Oh, alright then. I didn't want to assume a bartender would be familiar with such advanced mathematics." "Are you kidding me?" The bartender replies, "you learn limits in like, 9th grade! What kind of mathematician thinks limits are advanced mathematics?" "HE'S ON TO US!" the first mathematician screeches. Simultaneously, every mathematician opens their mouth and out pours a cloud of multicolored mosquitoes. Each mathematician is bellowing insects of a different shade. The mosquitoes form into a singular, polychromatic swarm. "FOOLS!" it booms in unison. "I WILL INFECT EVERY BEING ON THIS PATHETIC PLANET WITH MALARIA!" The bartender stands fearless against the technicolor hoard. "But wait," he interrupts. Thinking fast he says "If you do that, politicians will use the catastrophe as an excuse to implement free healthcare. Think of how much that will hurt the taxpayers!" The mosquitoes fall silent for a brief moment. "My God, you're right. We didn't think about the economy! Very well, we will not attack this dimension. FOR THE TAXPAYERS!" and with that, they vanish. A nearby barfly stumbles over to the bartender. "How did you know that that would work?" "It's simple really," the bartender says. "I saw that the vectors formed a gradient, and therefore must be conservative."</td></tr>

  <tr><td>One lunchtime a duck walks into a pub and orders a pint of beer and an all day breakfast. The bartender looks at him and says, "Wow! You're a duck." "I see your eyes are working," replies the duck. "And you can talk!" exclaims the bartender. "I see your ears are working, too," says the duck. "Now if you don't mind, can I have my beer and my fry up please?" "Certainly, sorry about that" says the bartender as he pours the duck a pint. "It's just we don't get many ducks in this pub. What are you doing around this way?" "I'm working on the building site across the road," explains the duck. "I'm a plasterer." The flabbergasted bartender cannot believe the duck and wants to learn more, but takes the hint when the duck pulls out a newspaper from his bag and proceeds to read it. So, the duck reads his paper, drinks his beer, eats his fry up, bids the barman good day and leaves. The same thing happens every lunchtime for two weeks. Then one day the circus comes to town. The ringmaster comes into the pub for a pint and the bartender says to him "You're with the circus, aren't you? Well, I know this duck that could be just brilliant in your circus. He talks, drinks beer, eats fry ups, reads the newspaper and everything!" "Sounds marvelous," says the ringmaster, handing over his business card. "Get him to give me a call." So the next day when the duck comes into the pub the bartender says, "Hey Mr. Duck, I reckon I can line you up with a top job, paying really good money." "I'm always looking for the next job," says the duck. "Where is it?" "At the circus," says the bartender. "The circus?" repeats the duck. "That's right," replies the bartender. "The circus?!" the duck asks again. "With the big TENT?" "Yeah!" the bartender replies. "With all the animals who live in CAGES, and performers who live in CARAVANS?" says the duck. "Of course," the bartender replies. "And the tent has CANVAS sides and a big canvas roof with a big hole in the middle?" says the duck. "That's right!" says the bartender. The duck shakes his head in amazement, and says "Why would they want a plasterer?"</td></tr>

  <tr><td>There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted. About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off. The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak. The grim reaper swears. "Oh no! This always happens with identical twins". "What do you mean?" asks the dentist. "Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now." The dentist is noticeably upset. He says "Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life." The grim reaper asks "What do you have in mind?" The dentist thinks. "How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free." The grim reaper laughs. "I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose?" The dentist smiles. "I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide." "Very well" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom. Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. "You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance." The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles. It's unbelievable. The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth. The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. "You win, human. This time. Your brother will live." He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. "Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died." The dentist smiles on the phone and says. "That's interesting, bro. Today you might say that I also had a brush with death."</td></tr>

  <tr><td>In Medieval Europe, there once was a triangular lake. This triangular lake was quite large. So large, in fact, that three separate kingdoms were built on each side of this lake. These kingdoms were very different one from another. The first kingdom was the richest - smooth stone walls built like a fortress, lavish houses for all, and a generous king who made the lives of his townsfolk quite enjoyable. They had want for nothing, for they had many riches. The second kingdom wasn't as fine - its outer walls of cobblestone and wood held the middle-class villagers, who had to slap on some elbow grease once in a while to get things done. But the third kingdom was the most desolate of all - rotting walls of wood housed the peasants, farmers and slaves. Ridden with disease and dirt, one's dream house would be anywhere but here. One day, the king of the first kingdom decides he wants the lake, for it is a valuable resource, and so he wages war on the other two kingdoms over the lake, winner takes all. For such a war, the first kingdom sends out a hundred war-trained knights clad in the finest steel armor you've ever seen with polished swords and armored stallions of battle. To accompany them, a squire is assigned to each knight to tend to his every need, no matter how demanding. The second kingdom, since they're not as wealthy as the first, sends out fifty knights with top-notch leather armor and a few horses, as well as two dozen squires for the lot. The third kingdom sends out its only warrior with the suit of armor his father passed down to him when he died of smallpox. Seeing as said warrior is quite elderly, they task their king's only squire to him to aid him in his endeavours. The night before the battle, the first kingdom's knights have a huge party. They get drunk off their asses with wine and mead, and everyone has one hell of a night. The second kingdom's knights don't have such luxuries, so they sit around a large fire with pints of ale and recount battle-won victories of the past, with the squires offering music and dancing for entertainment. The third kingdom's lone knight decides he's not in the mood to party since he's way past 50, and has a small beer before nodding off under a tree. The squire makes him beef stew in a pot, and hoists it up in the tree with a noose around a thick branch to consume it for breakfast before their battle. The sun rises, roosters crow, and the knights awaken. The first kingdom's knights all have head-splitting migraines from their hangovers. The second kingdom's knights aren't doing that well either. The third kingdom's knight slept in. They collectively decide that no one's in the mood to wield a sword and kill anyone, so the three kingdoms send their squires out to battle. And what a battle! Blood was spilled, skulls were shattered, enemies were slain, and against all odds, the lone survivor of this massacre was the lone squire from the third kingdom. As was agreed by the three kings, the third kingdom was given the lake. I suppose it goes to show that the squire of the high-pot-and-noose is equal to the squires of its two opposing sides.</td></tr>

  <tr><td>Researchers for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority found over 200 dead crows near greater Boston recently, and there was concern that they may have died from Avian Flu. A Bird Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts. However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car. MTA then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause: when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger. The scientific conclusion was that while all the lookout crows could say "Cah", none could say "Truck."</td></tr>

  There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living. He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas. "You know what? No," said the executioner. "I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now." Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. The man looked at the executioner and said "Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor."</td></tr><tr><td>
